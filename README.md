*"Guess A Number" is a game in which "the computer", chooses a random number between "1 and 100", and your task is to guess this number.*<br>
*After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected.*<br>
*You win once you guess the correct number.*<br>
